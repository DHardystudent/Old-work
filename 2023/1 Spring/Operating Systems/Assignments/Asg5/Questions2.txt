We wish to implement a client-server fortune telling package. This    will be based upon the echo server discussed in lecture.  Note that we will not concern ourselves at this point with issues of security.

You will need to implement two programs:

client: An applicaiton that opens a client connection to the server application and requests a fortune to be send back to the client.
server: The server application listens on a socket for fortune requests.   It needs to respond to incoming request by randomly selecting a fortune string from a vector of fortunes loaded when the server starts.  The server needs to be able to handle multiple connections at the same time.
Implement this simple client/server application using sockets.  There is no preferred programming language for this assignment... use what you're most comfortable using for code-slinging.    Your applications should use port 9876 for both listening and responding.

You are required to implement a sufficient test suite to test your solution and this must be included with your submission.     

As is the norm, please bind your solution into a single PDF document and attach your solution to this question on Blackboard.
